"# llSPS-INT-2166-Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning" 

***Description :

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This project aims at  predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

### Here is the final node-red app url to test my both models ( life expectancy prediction model)
### goto "life expectancy ML model" tab for testing the ML model
### goto "life expectancy autoAI model" tab for testing the autoAI model

### my model's r2 score is 0.822 , so the prediction values may vary based on given input values. enter the best fit values to get best output.
